We have been learning about Volcanos this term - mostly using the GCP book [KS2 Discover & Learn: Geography - Volcanoes and Earthquakes Study Book](https://www.cgpbooks.co.uk/primary-books/ks2/geography/gvr21-ks2-discover-learn-geography-volcanoes-and-e)

We noticed that in the news is an eruptiuon in La Palma

The volcano is called Cumbre Vieja

<!--more-->

It is a composite or [stratovolcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratovolcano) - this means it is made up from layers of lava and ash.


The eruption is [classified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_Explosivity_Index) as Strombolian - described as explosive.

We found this YouTube channel really useful - providing easy to understand updates on what's happening - with more geology information than the news programmes.

Most volcanos form near tectonic plate boundaries - but La Palma isn't on one of these - the volcano is over a [hotspot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhSaE0omw9o)
